Motivator makes it easy to keep track of your goals and reward yourself when
you meet them.

The idea is simple: you're more likely to meet your goals when you feel good,
so go ahead and reward yourself for little victories.

No more beating yourself up with "shouldy thinking." Celebrate your
accomplishments, no matter how small, and you might start to love that early
morning jog or whatever it is you've been dreading.
